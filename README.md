# memories

Good day, everyone. I am pleased to introduce my first full-stack project, which I have named 'Memories'. For the client-side, I used 'Next'. For the server-side, I used 'Nodejs'. Additionally, I implemented 'Graphql' as the API for this project, and 'Mongo' to store data, along with 'Firebase' as the image store. The project it is called 'Memories' because it serves as a blog for sharing memorable experiences that the admin has encountered. The admin has full control over the site, including the ability to create and delete posts and comments. On the other hand, users can read, like and comment on the posts as well as delete their own comments.

This project has not been deployed, but you can view the source on Github. While it may not be a perfect project, I believe it is a great starting point.

Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to review my project, and I promise to continue improving my skills and knowledge in the field of software development. Have a pleasant day, everyone! :D
